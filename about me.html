            <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
            <p>Hello, my name is Ma. Lykha Margarette L. Salustiano, but you can call me Lykha for short. I'm a Computer Science student with average skills in programming and web design. I'm also an artist in my own way and a fictional author.</p>

            <h1>PROJECTS</h1>
            <p>These are the projects I worked on during my time as a student. While they may not be as polished as those created by professional programmers or web developers, I put my best effort into each of them. </p>

                    <h3>BANK INTERFACE</h3>
                    <p class="red-box">The bank interface in this program is the graphical user interface (GUI) where users interact with the banking system. It includes screens for creating accounts, logging in, and performing transactions like deposits and withdrawals. The interface uses tkinter widgets to display forms and options, and it handles user inputs and displays results. It connects with backend logic through the BankFacade class to manage account operations. Overall, it provides a user-friendly way to access and manage banking services.</p>

                    <h3>FUNERAL HANDBOOK</h3>
                    <p class="red-box">This code defines a FuneralServiceApp class using Tkinter to create a GUI for managing funeral services. The application has buttons for Home, Services, Handbook, and About sections, with each button opening a corresponding window displaying relevant information or forms. Users can submit service details via forms, which are then saved to a text file and displayed in a searchable handbook. The search_handbook method allows users to find entries by name, with fuzzy matching implemented through Levenshtein distance. The app also includes dynamic features like button effects, background images, and a suggestion list for the search functionality.</p>

                    <h3>ACTIVITY TRACKER</h3>
                    <p class="red-box">This Python script creates a Tkinter-based application to track and log the time spent on different active windows. The TaskManagerApp class sets up the GUI, including a Treeview to display the active windows and their usage time, and offers a button to view historical data. The track_time function runs in a separate thread, monitoring the currently active window and logging the time spent in it. Data is saved to Excel files when the application is closed. The get_active_window function retrieves the name of the active window and optionally extracts the URL if the window belongs to a browser.</p>
