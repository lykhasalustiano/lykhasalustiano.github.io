        <h1>HOBBIES AND SKILLS</h1>
        <p3>I have plenty of hobbies and skills that I've grown fond of over time. As I recognized some of them as abilities, I took it upon myself to learn more and sharpen these skills.</p3>

        <h3>WATCHING</h3>
        <p class="red-box">I have a deep interest in watching various types of series, including anime, C-dramas, K-dramas, and J-dramas. I particularly enjoy live-action adaptations of anime, as they bring a unique perspective to the stories I love. In addition to these, I also have a fondness for cartoons, which adds to my diverse entertainment tastes.</p>

        <h3>READING</h3>
        <p class="red-box">Growing up, I was captivated by fantasy books for kids and novels like Harry Potter by J.K. Rowling. My interests in horror, sci-fi, fiction, and romance shaped my reading habits and inspired me to write my own stories. These genres fueled my imagination and passion for storytelling, leading me to craft my own narratives.</p>

        <h3>DRAWING</h3>
        <p class="red-box">This ability runs in the family on my father's side. While I may not be as skilled as my uncle, who is especially talented, I have improved significantly over the years through practice. I focus on drawing cartoons, anime, and 3D portraits, and I'm always working to enhance my skills. I also put effort into refining my grammar and expanding my writing, aiming to create longer and more engaging pieces.</p>

      <h3>WRITING</h3>
      <p class="red-box">I love writing, especially fan fiction. For example, I sometimes create my own characters within a series I enjoy, making it feel like I'm part of the story. I also write my own stories and publish them on Wattpad, with 6 years of experience in creating fictional, fan-made content purely for fun.</p>
